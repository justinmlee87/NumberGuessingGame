# Development Environment

The purpose of this program is to develop a number guessing game. I utilized the Java language along with Visual Studio code.
In order to accomplish this, I had to set up the development environment for Java by installing and integrating it in to
my Visual Studio Code.

As previously mentioned, I used the Java language to create this program. I was able to successfully create the number
guessing game by creating classes, and a loop to run the guesses until the user guessed correctly or reached the maximum
number of attempts. Additionally, I added an interface which specified the behavior of one of my classes by utilizing abstraction. I called on this class through the implements feature.

# Future Work

- I'd like to add a GUI to the program for a more user friendly view.
- I'd like to enhance the guessing game by adding responses such as "Way too high", "way too low" or "getting closer" to help further guide the user to making the correct choice.
- It might be interesting to implement a feature that once the user guesses correctly, the CPU and User reverse roles and now the CPU has to guess the random number selected by the user.
